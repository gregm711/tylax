\begin{abstract}
 The process of scientific writing is often tangled up with the intricacies of typesetting, leading to frustration and wasted time for researchers. In this paper, we introduce Typst, a new typesetting system designed specifically for scientific writing. Typst untangles the typesetting process, allowing researchers to compose papers faster. In a series of experiments we demonstrate that Typst offers several advantages, including faster document creation, simplified syntax, and increased ease-of-use.
