\section{Using This Template}

The approach to this template is to result in LaTeX source files (i.e., .tex files) that are as simple as possible. This is particularly useful for the first few pages, for example the title page, dedication, and abstract page, which are difficult to make in LaTeX and are supposed to go in a certain order.

You are welcome to modify thesis-umich.cls to suit your needs or keep up with modifications to Rackham guidelines. I used this template to submit my dissertation in 2019, but Rackham can change their rules at any time. If you have not modified a .cls file before, but know how to define commands in TeX, you should not have much trouble, apart from the sneaky @ character, which behaves like a letter in .cls files but not in .tex (see \href{https://tex.stackexchange.com/q/8351/21027}{What do texttttextbackslash makeatletter and texttttextbackslash makeatother do?'' on TeX\\ StackOverflow} and \href{https://tug.org/pipermail/tugindia/2002-January/000178.html}{Makeatletter and Makeatother'' on the TeX\\ Users Group} for more information).

Finally, you should be able to use your preferred bibliography manager (BibTex, BibLaTeX, NatBib, etc.). If the \textbackslash{}textbackslash bibliography command is giving you trouble, look in thesis-umich.cls, because it was modified there. You can also look at that code for help with formatting bibliographies that are displayed with other commands.

\section{Example Appendix}

\subsection{Lists Including the Appendices}

The command \textbackslash{}showlistofappendices

must appear in the preamble if there are more than one appendices. For some reason, Rackham does not want the individual appendices and their sections to appear in the Table of Contents, so a special List of Appendices page (which must occur in the Table of Contents!) is required as a sort of extension to the Table of Contents.
