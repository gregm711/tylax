Dear Ms. Doe,

I am writing to express my interest in the Senior Developer position at Acme Corporation, as advertised on your company website. With over eight years of experience in software development and a proven track record of delivering high-quality solutions, I believe I would be a valuable addition to your team.

In my current role at Tech Solutions Inc., I have led development teams on several successful projects, including the implementation of a microservices architecture that improved system performance by 40\%. I am proficient in multiple programming languages and frameworks, and I have extensive experience with agile methodologies.

I am particularly drawn to Acme Corporation's commitment to innovation and your recent initiatives in sustainable technology. I am confident that my skills and experience align well with your company's goals.

I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my background and expertise could benefit Acme Corporation. Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to hearing from you.

Sincerely,

John Smith
